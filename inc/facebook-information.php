	<h4> how the facebook JSON-feed works:</h4>
	<p>To use this and convert it to JSON-text, you need to be an administrator of a facebook-page to get the feed.
		first of all, you need to press the link that says "authenticate facebook".
		After you've authenticated your facebook to the plugin, a text-field should appear that requires you to enter a page-id which is found<br>
		in the page settings. Copy the ID and press the submit button. After that, the json-feed should be saved in the database. </p>

	<h4> Database tables:</h4>
	<p> The information specified and given is saved on a local database with the tablenames:
	<p id = "underline"> facebook-access-token:</p> in which the access token given from facebook is stored.
	<p id = "underline">page-id:</p> the id in which was specified in the text field.
	<p id= "underline">facebook-JSON-result:</p> the result and converted values from the facebook feed.
